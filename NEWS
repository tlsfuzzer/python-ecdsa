* Release 0.8 (04 Oct 2011)

Small API addition: accept a hashfunc= argument in the constructors for
SigningKey and VerifyingKey. This makes it easier to write wrappers that e.g.
use NIST256p and SHA256 without their obligating callers to pass
hashfunc=sha256 in each time they call sign() or verify().

* Release 0.7 (28 Nov 2010)

Fix test failure against OpenSSL-1.0.0 (previous versions only worked against
openssl-0.9.8 or earlier). Increase python requirement to py2.5 or later
(still no py3 compatibility, but work is underway). Replace use of obsolete
'sha' library with modern 'hashlib'. Clean up unit test runner (stop using
subprocesses).

* Release 0.6 (15 Oct 2010)

Small packaging changes: extract version number from git, add 'setup.py test'
command, set exit code correctly on test failure. Fix pyflakes warnings.

* Release 0.5 (27 Apr 2010)

Initial release. EC-DSA signature for five NIST "Suite B" GF(p) curves:
prime192v1, secp224r1, prime256v1, secp384r1, and secp521r1. DER/PEM
input/output functions, seed-to-randrange helper functions.
